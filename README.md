# StarChart
This app converts three dimensional star positions into two dimensional star charts.

## Server Side
I really just want a very simple server side app to pull, shape, and return data from a db.

## Client Side
This is where the fun happens! Getting raw data from the server I want to build an AngularJS front end to be uber responsive. Eventually there can actually be user interactions!
